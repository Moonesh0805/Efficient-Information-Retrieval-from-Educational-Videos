### Efficient Information Retrieval from Educational Videos Using AI-Based Transcription and Summarization

Efficient Information Retrieval from Educational Videos Using AI-Based Transcription and Summarization is an intelligent learning support system that automatically converts educational videos into structured, searchable notes. The system extracts spoken content from videos, transcribes it into text, and generates concise summaries and key concepts to help students quickly understand important topics. It significantly reduces the time required to manually watch lengthy lectures and improves learning efficiency.

### About

Efficient Information Retrieval from Educational Videos Using AI-Based Transcription and Summarization is an AI-driven educational tool designed to transform raw lecture videos into meaningful textual knowledge. Traditional learning from long educational videos can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially when students need to revise specific topics or exam-related concepts. This project addresses these challenges by using AI-based transcription and summarization techniques to automatically process video content.

The system first extracts audio from uploaded educational videos and converts speech into text using speech-to-text techniques. The generated transcript is then analyzed to identify important concepts, definitions, formulas, and exam-relevant points. These insights are organized into structured notes along with timestamps, allowing users to jump directly to relevant sections of the video. By automating information extraction, the system minimizes manual effort, improves accuracy, and enhances knowledge retention. The platform operates offline and provides a user-friendly interface for uploading videos and accessing summarized content, making it suitable for students, educators, and self-learners.

### Features

AI-based transcription of educational videos into text.

Automatic summarization of lectures into concise notes.

Identification of key concepts, definitions, and important points.

Timestamp-based navigation to jump to relevant video segments.

Offline processing for data privacy and accessibility.

User-friendly interface for uploading videos and viewing notes.

Export of generated notes in structured formats such as PDF.

### Requirements
